    "Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and integrates seamlessly with it. This integration allows you to leverage the strengths of both libraries, combining Seaborn's statistical plotting capabilities with Matplotlib's flexibility and fine-grained control. Let's explore how Seaborn works with Matplotlib and how you can combine commands from both libraries.\n",

    "### <a id='toc5_1_'></a>[How Seaborn Works on Top of Matplotlib](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "Seaborn uses Matplotlib as its plotting backend. This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every Seaborn plot is essentially a Matplotlib plot.\n",
    "2. Seaborn functions return Matplotlib Axes or Figure objects.\n",
    "3. You can use Matplotlib commands to further customize Seaborn plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example to illustrate this relationship:\n",
    "\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
